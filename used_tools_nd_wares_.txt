design tables, flow etc 

Sir I have been experimenting with the instrument database, about how to place them automatically and how their individual ID will be generated and will be displayed. 
Meanwhile I got these questions, please address them-

I still have confusion about much portion of the flow, and without knowing the flow it is difficult to design the workframe, am I overthinking the project? maybe. If possible then discussion over a call will be better.

1. the system will have 3 tiers - superuser/ head, faculties/lab assistants, users- students and corporates, additional panel will be for the company side who'll check for maintenance date you've mentioned. 
>> in last meeting madam said about PI system instead of Students as user. Which one to go for?
and if we go for PI system, then should there be a dashboard for users as well?

2. the payment flow, whom the students will pay, how the payment will be detected etc.

Is it possible to get help from Computer centre for these things -
1. security design if they have any existing secure code. if that is confidential then it's fine I'll just use a dummy one. 


1. security system - a well designed login signin system
2. certificate auto generation
